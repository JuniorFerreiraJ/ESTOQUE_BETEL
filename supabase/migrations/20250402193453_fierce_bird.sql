/*
  # Add user name tracking to inventory history

  1. Changes
    - Add `user_name` column to `inventory_history` table
    - This will store the name of the user who made the movement
    - Using text type for flexibility and to avoid user table dependencies

  2. Notes
    - Using text field instead of foreign key for simplicity since auth was removed
    - Existing records will have NULL in the new column
